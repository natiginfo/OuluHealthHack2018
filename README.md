# OuluHealthHack2018

Doctor Asked is app for self diagnosis built at Oulu Health Hack 2018 using the API provided by CGI. For now there are no unit tests.

**Note:** as CGI closed API access, this app uses mock server. Mock server is hosted on Postman, so, there're some usage limits.
Therefore, if you see error messages from server side, I recommend you to import mock server details to Postman from ```mock``` folder.
After running your server, make sure you update API_URL variable on ```data/build.gradle``` file.
