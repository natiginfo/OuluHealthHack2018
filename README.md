# OuluHealthHack2018

Doctor Asked is app for self diagnosis built at Oulu Health Hack 2018 using the API provided by CGI. For now there are no unit tests.

**Note:** as CGI closed API access, you cannot directly use the app. However, if you have access to that API, you can add required URL, token and user_id and check out the app.
